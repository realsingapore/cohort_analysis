Projects -Cohort Analysis for assessing customer retention in E-commerce industry.

__

**Rationale for cohort analysis**

**Cohort analysis** is a powerful technique used in business analytics to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of specific groups of customers, users, or any defined segments over time. These groups, or cohorts, share a common characteristic or experience, such as the date of their first purchase, sign-up, or acquisition.

The primary purpose of cohort analysis is to track how different cohorts perform and behave over their entire lifecycle, allowing businesses to understand their customer retention, engagement, and revenue generation patterns. Here's a breakdown of key elements in cohort analysis:

**Cohort analysis** is a valuable tool in the realm of customer retention because it provides businesses with a greater understanding of customer behavior over time. Here are reasons why carrying out cohort analysis is essential for assessing and improving customer retention:

- **Identifying Retention Trends**: Cohort analysis allows businesses to group customers based on shared traits, such as their acquisition date or first purchase. By tracking these cohorts over time, it becomes easier to identify trends in customer behavior, whether retention rates are increasing or decreasing.

- **Pinpointing Churn Patterns**: Cohort analysis helps in identifying when and why customers tend to churn or stop making repeat purchases. This information is crucial for devising strategies to reduce churn and retain more customers.

Why Churn Prediction?

Churn prediction is a strategic approach that utilizes customer data to identify clients who are less likely to renew their contracts. Initiating this project is crucial for addressing current challenges and enhancing Reder Telecom’s operational effectiveness.

Key Reasons for Churn Prediction

1. Cost Reduction
   Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Reducing churn leads to substantial savings.

2. Revenue Growth
   Lower churn rates result in higher revenue, as long-term customers are more likely to purchase additional services.

3. Customer Satisfaction
   Understanding customer behavior and preferences allows Reder Telecom to improve service quality, boosting satisfaction and loyalty.

4. Competitive Advantage 
   Using data analytics to predict churn enables Reder Telecom to proactively retain customers and outperform competitors.
